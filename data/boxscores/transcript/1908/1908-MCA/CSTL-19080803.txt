league: Cotton States
away: Meridian
home: Jackson
source: (Memphis) Commercial Appeal, August 7, 1908
status: forfeited
forfeit-to: home
status-reason: Meridian ran out of players to continue game, having brought only 10 players, after Robb and Yount were ejected - Jackson was leading 1-0 in the 4th inning when the 2nd player (Yount) was ejected - umpire allowed game to continue as an exhibition game for those in attendance

note: source has boxscore of the game, but assumption is made that the statistics are not part of the official record, therefore the boxscore is not captured here
note: ejection - Robb ejected in the 3rd inning for 'kicking' at umpire's decision
note: ejection - Yount ejected in the 4th inning for abuse towards umpire when Larocuqe called Blackburn's hit a fair ball

note: Boyd 'broke his left shoulder blade' when diving for home plate and was replaced by Lively - per recap, this happened in the 3rd inning, but Boyd scored Gulfport-Biloxi's only run in the 2nd inning per the box and line score, so it it likely this injury occurred in the 2nd inning
