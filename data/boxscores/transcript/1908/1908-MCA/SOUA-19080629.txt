note: addenda (sidebar) to the recap discusses the usual argument as to which pitcher is to be credited for the victory - decision is made by League President Kavanaugh - but the thought is that Garrity will be credited with the victory, as he pitched 13 of the 15 innings and 'was not beaten when he retired,' but was 'taken out for a better batter.'
