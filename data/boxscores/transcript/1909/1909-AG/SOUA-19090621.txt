P_IP: Manuel #2.0; Robinson #10.2
note: correction - summary records Robinson with 11 IP, but per recap, Robinson relieved Manuel in the 3rd with no outs, runners on 2nd and 3rd, and 2 runs already in, and pitched until the winning run was scored with two out in the 13th inning, so Robinson is properly credited with 10.2 IP, and the figure is corrected above
