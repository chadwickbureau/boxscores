note: correction - box lists Bauer only as P - per recap, Bockenfohr went into RF temporarily, 'being relieved by Bauer as soon as Luhrsen had warmed up to pitch' - Bauer's position assignment is corrected above
note: discrepancy - Bauer is not recorded with any ABs, although conclusion is that Bauer played almost the entire game - also, recap states that Cook faced only 30 batters, and only 2 BB and 0 HP by Cook are recorded, so very likely there should be 28 total ABs by Alexandria

note: Mercer left game after being hit on the band while batting in unknown inning - however this incident must have happened in the top of the 7th inning or later, as Mercer was still noted to be pitching in the scoring details of the bottom of the 6th inning

note: discrepancy - player positions transcribed in order given - per recap, Dillon 'finished' the game at pitcher, but perhaps the writer left before the game's conclusion, as Taylor, Jeffries, and Carroll also took turns pitching - the only position issue is that someone else (probably Carroll) had to play catcher or first base while Taylor and Jeffries each pitched

note: correction - box lists Pedrotti only in CF, but per summary, Pedrotti also pitched - the position assignment is corrected above
note: discrepancy - box lists 29 total Monroe ABs, but player totals add up to 25 - it is likely that Wing (Ling) should be recorded with 4 ABs rather than 1, as Deardorf had no walks and just one HB, and Monroe had no SHs recorded
note: discrepancy - box lists 24 total Monroe POs, but player totals add up to 25
note: discrepancy - box lists 13 total Monroe assists and 7 total Monroe errors, but player totals add up to 15 and 8 respectively - Quick's fielding line duplicates Pedrotti's and it is more likely that Pedrotti had 2 assists (having moved to pitcher) than Quick in LF
note: discrepancy - box lists only Pedrotti in CF, but another player (probably Blanchfield or Topperwein) had to go to CF when Pedrotti moved to the mound - if Blanchfield went to CF, then possibly Topperwein went to RF
note: discrepancy - it is likely that Wing (Ling) did not go into RF when Kitchens moved to catcher - rathan, Wing (Ling) likely replaced Kitchens at 1B
