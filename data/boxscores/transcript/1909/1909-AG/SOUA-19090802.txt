note: ejection - Neighbors of Mobile was ejected in the 1st inning by Pfenninger for kicking on a decision
note: appearance - (from the New Orleans Times-Democrat of the same date) Neighbors was in the Mobile starting lineup, in the 7th spot, to play RF - the ejection occurred in the top of the 1st inning before Neighbors had appeared in the game at the plate or in the field - McCay was to start at 1B, but took RF in the bottom of the 1st inning, and Sabrie entered the game at the 7th spot in the order, to play 1B
