note: this was the morning game of a 'holiday' doubleheader - there was a misunderstanding by the Mobile club if a morning game was to be played, but the league constitution specifically mandates a morning and an afternoon game to be played on the Independence Day holiday - the Mobile club had just arrived in town mid-morning from Memphis - the New Orleans team arrived to a locked park, climbed the fence, took positions on the field, and umpire Carpenter awarded the game by forfeit - this action was upheld by the league
