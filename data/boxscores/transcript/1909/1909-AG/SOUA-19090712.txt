note: game limited to 7 innings by agreement
note: discrepancy - per the recap, '... a decision by Rudderham in the sixth, eliminating a run from Molesworth, ... enraged the players....  Gygli was put out of the game and Molesworth out of the park.' - however, the box does not record a substitution for either player
note: the Birmingham fans threw bottles and pillows on the field in protest of the decision in the 6th inning, and police were called to escort the umpire off the field
