note: ejection - Wells ejected in top of 1st inning for arguing after he was picked up first base
note: ejection - Hastings ejected in top of 5th inning - his long drive with the bases full was called foul, and subsequently Hastings struck out - then he was tossed after starting an argument with umpire\

note: Fort Smith had dresssed only 10 players and the ejections left them with 8 on the field - umpire was about to forfeit the game when Hudson, one of the directors of Fort Smith and in attendance, volunteered to enter the game - Hudson put on Hastings' uniform, and was switched between RF and LF depending on the batter - per recap, this was the first uniform Hudson had ever worn

P_IP: Blackwood #7.0; Jones #2.0
note: correction - summary records 7 2-3 IP for Blackwood and 1 1-3 IP for Jones - the fractional IP is probably a function of batters faced in the inning - per recap, Blackwood faced 4 batters without getting an out - Jones was substituted, got two batters out and picked off the runner at 2nd
