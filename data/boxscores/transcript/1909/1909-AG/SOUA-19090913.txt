note: correction - the summary lists McMurray, Fisher, Jordan, and Bartley with doubles, and Collins, Newton, Moran, and Hoey with triples - per the recap, Newton doubled, Fisher tripled, Collins doubled, Jordan tripled, Bartley tripled, and Moran doubled - it is apparently that the grouping for 2Bs and 3Bs was transposed, and so this is corrected above
