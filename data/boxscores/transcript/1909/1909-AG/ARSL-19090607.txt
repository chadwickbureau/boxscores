note: discrepancy - box lists 28 total Fort Smith ABs, but player totals add up to 29 - it would be impossible for Hoffman to have 5 ABs given that only two Fort Smith players reached base (confirmed by recap details)
note: correction - box lists 0 Fort Smith hits and player totals add up to zero - however, per recap, 'Earthman in the first inning... hit one to McDonald and the ball took a bad bounce... Earthman was given credit for a hit, but it was the biggest kind of a fluke, and it was practically a no-hit no-run game' - therefore Earthman's line record is corrected above

note: correction - box lists Heiglefort only as RF - per recap, Heiglefort switched positions with Bromley and finished game as the catcher, as Bromley was having problems with passed balls - Heiglefort's position assignment is corrected above
