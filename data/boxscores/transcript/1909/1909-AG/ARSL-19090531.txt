note: umpire announced game forfeited to Texarkana prior to start, as Fort Smith did not have two new balls to put into play for the game - 'some person unknown had poured oil of mustard on one of the balls to prevent the use of the spit ball and the ruse was discovered'
note: the gathered crowd insisted that a game be played and so an exhibition contest was waged, which was won by Fort Smith 3-2

note: addition - box at source records only 8 players for Helena, missing the LF - Hoffman is recorded with a double in the summary, and Fort Smith's Hoffman is hitless in this game - therefore assumption is made that Hoffman of Helena is the missing player, and an entry for him is appended to the box above

B_2B: Hoffman [Hel]; Berry; Carroll; Earthman
