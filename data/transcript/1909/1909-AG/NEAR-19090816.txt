note: correction - box lists McDonald in RF, but the summary records strikeouts and walks off McDonald - it is reasonable to assume that McDonald pitched - this is corrected above
note: correction - box lists both Welch and Darling as pitchers, but notes that both entered the game as pinch-hitters in the ninth inning - it is reasonable to conclude that neither pitched in this game, and the position listing for both is corrected above
note: missing data - after corrections above, Paragould box has 8 position players and 2 notated pinch-hitters, with no RF in the lineup - however, the player and team totals justify - an entry has been appended to the box for unknown player in RF

Williamson @ p:	3 1 1 0 4 0
McAdams @ cf:	1 0 1 0 0 0
TOTALS:		37 4 10 30 14 3

note: discrepancy - Allen and Hardin are both listed in LF with 8 ABs between them, and McAdams is the only player listed in CF, having 1 AB - it is likely that Hardin (the usual regular CF) was in CF this game, and McAdams substituted for Hardin
