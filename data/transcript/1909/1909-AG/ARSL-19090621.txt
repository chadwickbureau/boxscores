note: problem - the boxscore below has issues that may not be resolved, as this is the only boxscore found (thus far) for this game - in addition to the discrepancies presented below, Dehaven and Naylor each have 5 recorded plate appearances if the figures are correct, but the players in the 1-6 spots in the Hot Springs lineup only have 4 plate appearances recorded each - it is also likely that Robertson pitched the entire game for Jonesboro

Hot Springs:	ab r h po a e

Heiglefort @ p:	4 0 1 0 3 0
TOTALS:		34 1 10 27 10 1

note: discrepancy - Russell is listed twice in the box with the same stat line, once with no position given, and no SS is listed - it is likely that the regular SS, Smitheal, appeared in the game in his usual 3rd spot in the order, and a line of "4 0 1 0 3 0" would justify the individual results and the team total
note: correction - box lists 28 total Hot Springs POs, but player totals add up to 27 and total should be 27 per number of defensive innings played, so this total is corrected above
note: discrepancy - box lists 10 total Hot Springs assists, but player totals add up to 7

F_DP: Ware, Coyle; Robertson, Deardorff, Henninger; Heiglefort, Naylor
note: discrepancy - F_DP transcribed as given, but the Robertson-Deardorff-Henninger DP would certainly be inconsistent with the other information presented, since Robertson and Deardorff are both listed only as pitcher - possibly Deardorff did not come into game to pitch, but replaced another infielder - however Deardorff is also not listed with any assists in the box
note: summary does not record any P_BB
note: missing data - summary does not record time of game
note: missing data - summary does not record umpire - Smith was the umpire in the previous game

P_GS: ~Robertson
P_GF: ~Deardorff
P_L: ~Robertson
P_R: ~Robertson #1
note: discrepancy - above presented with caveat that perhaps Deardorff did not come into game as a pitcher

note: problem - the boxscore below has issues that may not be resolved - a boxscore from the Jonesboro paper is available which records a completely different stat line for most of the players - at first review, the Jonesboro paper appears to have the more internally consistent boxscore

TOTALS:		37 4 10 24 5 4

note: discrepancy - the box lists only F. Kitchens playing catcher, but also lists Kitchens in LF - it would seem doubtful that F. Kitchens played in LF this game
note: discrepancy - the box lists both Wright and Hewitt at 3B, with no SS in lineup - Hewitt is the regular 3B
note: discrepancy - box lists 37 total Monroe ABs, but player totals add up to 38
note: discrepancy - box lists 24 total Monroe POs, but player totals add up to 25
note: discrepancy - box lists 5 total Monroe assists, but player totals add up to 15
