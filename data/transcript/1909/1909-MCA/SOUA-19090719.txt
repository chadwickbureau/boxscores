note: Hart left game in the bottom of the 6th inning with an injured finger from a foul tip - Daley first substituted for Hart, per the recap, but he did a poor job catching, and Rockenfield replaced Daley as catcher

note: correction - there is no entry under the run column for the Montgomery totals - per player totals, recap, and line score, Montgomery scored 2 runs, so this has been corrected
note: discrepancy - box lists 30 total Montgomery POs, but Montgomery would have 39 total putouts as they played 13 defensive innings
