*: batted for Barber in 1st inning
note: above box and batted note transcribed as given - likely scenario, as gleaned from other sources, is that the lineup card had Taylor in LF and Blakney in RF - after Taylor's at-bat, he disputed with his manager and was benched - Barber entered game in bottom of 1st inning in RF and Blakney was moved to LF
note: box lists 38 total Jackson ABs, but player totals add up to 33
note: box lists 8 total Jackson hits, but player totals add up to 7
note: box lists 30 total Jackson putouts, but player totals add up to 29
note: box lists 13 total Jackson assists, but player totals add up to 9
note: box does not list player Kline or position ss - assuming Kline played ss, I have inserted the info above in a random lineup spot
