source: (Memphis) Commercial Appeal, August 24, 1908
home-batted: first

note: as the game ended in the 13th inning when Montgomery scored the winning run, it is clear that the Memphis manager (Babb) chose to bat first - recap does not elaborate on this decision

home: Mobile
source: (Memphis) Commercial Appeal, August 24, 1908

note: byline of the source recap/box is Birmingham, but August 23 paper listing of 'today's games' has the game at Mobile
note: game called with one out in the bottom of the 8th inning due to a heavy rain which stopped the game at that point for 25 minutes, 'making it impossible to continue'

note: correction - box lists 25 total Birmingham POs, but player totals add up to 22 - as recap states that the game ended with one out in the bottom of the 8th, the total number of POs accrued by Birmingham should be 22, and so this figure is corrected here
note: discrepancy - box lists 29 total Birmingham ABs, but player totals add up to 30
