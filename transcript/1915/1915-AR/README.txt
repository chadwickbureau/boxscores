These are boxscores from the 1915 Arizona Republic, compiled by
Jack Morris.

These cover the Rio Grande Association.  As of November 2017, only the
last week of games has been transcribed, as previous weeks have been
covered by at least one other already-transcribed source.  Capture of
the remaining weeks from this source is still desired, eventually.
