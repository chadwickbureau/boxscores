note: missing data - recap asserts that catcher Massing allowed 4 Memphis 'stealers' - Donohue may be the other player io mind, as later, the recap states, 'The Last runs were made with two outs, and were results of singles by Shields and Donohue, both stealing, and a scratch single to Sentell.'  However, summary does not assign a SB to Donohue.
note: missing data - 'notes of the game' also submits that Schwenck stole 2nd in the 2nd inning
