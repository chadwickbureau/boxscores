B_2B: Sample; Klawitter; Herold
note: discrepancy - Sample is not credited with a hit in the box - this may be a mis-print and another player should be assigned the 2B - the recap states that the home team (Jackson) made a two-bagger in the 7th inning, but no Jackson player is credited with a 2B here
