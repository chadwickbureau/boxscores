note: box lists 27 total Jackson POs, but player totals add up to 24
note: box lists 9 total Jackson assists, but player totals add up to 10
note: box lists 3 total Jackson errors, but player totals add up to 4
note: discrepancies above could be result of Klein's line copied to Barber's line, or vice versa - if so, working backwards from totals, it appears that one of the two players should have a box line of '3 0 1 3 1 0'
