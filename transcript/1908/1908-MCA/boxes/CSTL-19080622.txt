note: Jackson box transcribed as given, but Barber apparently is assigned Ott's box line (as Ott tripled, and, as catcher, would have been assigned the majority of putouts by strikeout) - if other player totals and team totals are correct, Barber would have box line of '1 0 0 0 0 0'.
note: box lists 28 total Jackson ABs, but player totals add up to 31 - see above note
