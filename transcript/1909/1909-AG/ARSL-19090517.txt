note: discrepancy - Vandegrift is listed at SS for Jonesboro, but Vandegrift is the manager of the Helena team - the Alexandria paper of May 19 lists Van at SS for Jonesboro
note: discrepancy - Henninger's box line duplicates McDonald's, but must be incorrect (as his batterymate Kimbell is listed with 6 SOs) - none of the box totals reconcile
note: discrepancy - box lists 1 total Jonesboro error, but player totals add up to 2
