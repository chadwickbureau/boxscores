B_HP: Tonneman; Seigle; Butler #2; Bowen
P_HP: Ford #4; Duggan #1
note: correction - summary states 'Hit by pitcher - Ford, Tonneman, Seigle, Butler 2, Duggan, Bowen' - since Ford and Duggan are credited with 4 ABs, it is doubtful that each had a 5th plate appearance under the game circumstances - it is reasonable to conclude that this is a grouping of B_HP first by Ford, and then by Duggan
