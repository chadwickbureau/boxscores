note: in the game recap, the anonymous reporter for the Appeal, under the subheading 'Some Funny Scoring,' states: 'The summary of today's game was also a peculiar affair.  It showed no bases on balls nor sacrifice hits, yet they were recorded.  The derelict [Montgomery scorer] also insists on refusing every season to credit catchers with put outs and pitchers with strike-outs when batters bunt themselves out on strikes.'

note: the Appeal reporter commented again on the scoring in this recap: 'The scoring was again a source of wonder.  There are several scores kept, and while one is an official score, few seem authentic.  Hurlburt's passed ball today does not appear in the summary, and some scorers here say that Lively struck out six men, whil others claim that he claimed seven victims.'
