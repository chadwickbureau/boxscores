This is a list of newspapers which covered the indicated leagues completely
(that is, boxscores for all games in the league and not just home/selected
ones).

This includes newspapers which are available online, and
excludes leagues (for the most part) which were covered by Sporting
Life or Sporting News (both of which are available online).

Many thanks to Chuck McGill for assistance in compiling this list.
Additions to the list are welcomed.
